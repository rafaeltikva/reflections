What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a repository, with the .git directory of the local branch holding the information & metadata of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area provides an intermediate area for applying only the changes i'm interested in, instead of including my entire working directory. this gives me the needed flexibility to choose exactly what changes should be included in a commit, vs changes that are still in development
