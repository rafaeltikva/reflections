What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a repository, with the .git directory of the local branch holding the information & metadata of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area provides an intermediate area for applying only the changes i'm interested in, instead of including my entire working directory. this gives me the needed flexibility to choose exactly what changes should be included in a commit, vs changes that are still in development

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by adding the files relevant to the logical change to the staging area, and therefore not affecting the rest of the files in my working directory

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

they allow us to separate our working repository from our testing/dev repositor. this can be helpful for testing certain features, fixing bugs, adding new modes, test different ideas and concepts etc'.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

it helps me identify the tree, and lets me experiment on a certain commit without worrying it will have affect on my branch, or alternatively, i can "export" commits to a separate branch without affecting the original branch
